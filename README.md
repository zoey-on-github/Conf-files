config files for various things


i use vim-plug as my neovim plugin manager, so you need to have that installed and you need to run `PlugInstall` for all my plugins to install

my zshrc sets vim bindings in zsh, and makes it so that when you press escape and v at the same time, you can open your current command in (neo)vim

i also alias `cat` to [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), a `cat` alternative written in rust that contains some nice convience features like syntax highlighting and line numbers.

i also have an alias for a semi-interactive `cd`(type `icd`) that lets you search through your directories with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and press enter to cd to them
